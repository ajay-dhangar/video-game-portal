          Story driven games are focused on developing a story line and the
          characters in it. These kinds of games are for people who love
          investing themselves in these fictional stories and the characters in
          them. These games are usually long and memorable, and most of the time
          utilize realistic graphics. Here are some examples of story driven
          games!
